# Tangent

Tangent is an iOS app that allows you to convert handwritten math equations from your notes to beautifully typed digital text.

# How it works

I want to help you better document your notes digitally.
I have made the transfer process as easy as snapping a picture.

Simply, take a picture of the specific equations or math problems from your notes and Tangent converts the image to text on your phone.

We aim to further our goals by actively developing the following features in our upcoming updates:
1. Copy and paste equations by pressing 1 button.
2. Search through math problems you have saved.
3. Generate practice tests from math problems in your library.

# Technology and Process

I developed custom interface with React Native Camera enabling micro-measurements with > 90% accuracy.

I architected a Node.js backend with Mathpix and KaTeX APIs to convert 800+ raw image data objects to rendered html.
